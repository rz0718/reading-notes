## Robo-Advising Less AI and More XAI
a. Robo-advising is more attractive to relatively young households which reflect a combination of their lower wealth as well as increased willingness to trust technology.

b. It would be more effective to disclose, for example, which economic scenarios may cause the algorithm to perform less accurately, possibly proving ex-post sub-optimal, and informing clients about the potential limitations of the algorithms. 

c. Most methods are using mean-variance analysis. Wealthfront is using black-litterman. Schwab intelligent is using a variant of markowitz approach (using conditional value at risk instead of variance).
